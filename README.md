## About this Repo: 
This repository is my high school sophomore year FBLA project for the website design competition. 

This is a website about an imaginary organization called SmallTown STEAM, which offers STEAM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Art, MAth) courses to the residents of the imaginary Smalltown, USA. 

It features a dynamic course offering page, with features for webadmins to add new courses to the site. 

This was my first attemp at any sort of website development.



## How you need to run this Repo:
Anyone can use this code as long as they have a web server.

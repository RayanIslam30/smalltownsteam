<p>Over their academic journey, a group of local students noticed a need for greater intersection of traditional STEM subjects and the arts. They yearned for ways to combine their artistic inclinations with a scientific and technological education. To fulfill this childhood desire and provide such education to young children, they have created SmallTown STEAM, an online learning platform to introduce young children to connections in the world of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math). </p>

<p>SmallTown STEAM aims to inspire young children to uncover new passions and build connections with existing educational curriculums and pathways. We achieve this by providing interactive online courses, activities, and unique resources to network to the local community. By catering this niche and specialized STEAM education to young children, SmallTown STEAM works to broaden students understanding of STEM, the arts, and their innate correlation.</p>
